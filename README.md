# CIAngel

Now we can build CIAs on the 3DS!
Using a Title ID and an encrypted title key, a GOOD CIAs will be produced that can be redownloaded from eshop and updated from eshop if new content comes out. These CIAs will not interfere with content from eshop.

Many thanks for machinamentum and FirmwareDownloader! Thanks to make_cdn_cia!

This will be improved, updated, I look forward to people contributing to this project!


CIAngel can read a text file (sd:/CIAngel/input.txt) that has 2 lines.

The first line must be the title id.
The second line must be the encrypted title key.

CIAngel has a keyboard (HBKBLib) that can be used to enter a title id and key on the device!
