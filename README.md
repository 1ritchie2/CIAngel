# CIAngel

Now we can build CIAs on the 3DS!
Using a Title ID and an encrypted title key, a GOOD CIAs will be produced that can be redownloaded from eshop and updated from eshop if new content comes out. These CIAs will not interfere with content from eshop.

Many thanks for machinamentum and FirmwareDownloader! Thanks to make_cdn_cia!

This will be improved, updated, I look forward to people contributing to this project!
In the current for, CIAngel is limited.
At the moment, CIAngel will read a text file (input.txt) with 2 lines.

The first line must be the title id.

The second line must be the encrypted title key.

**The text file must have linux line endings.**
