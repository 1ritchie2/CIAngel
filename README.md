# FirmwareDownloader

An open source 3DS homebrew app for downloading system update titles from NUS directly to the console (packed in CIA format). Based on code from 3DNUS and make_cdn_cia. License is GPL to comply with the usage of make_cdn_cia code. The code is simple enough to be integrated into a CIA installer to have a complete, but more flexible, alternative to the official system updater.

TODO:
 * Parse CSV files
 * Download user-specified firmwares
 * For New3DS users: optionally download system apps that are sometimes missing during a region change (Music, MiiMaker, etc).
